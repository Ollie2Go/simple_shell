The shell project is a highly anticipated project for ALX students and tests students through a holistic approach of questioning us on all the fundam
etals of the C language we have learnt so far. For this group project, we have to create our own shell, using basic functions provided by the manual
guidelines according to the project. The rules for the project are very strict and paramaters for system calls that are allowed to be used, are very specific. Betty coding style is mandatory. No more than 5 functions are allowed for each file. EOFs should also be included.
